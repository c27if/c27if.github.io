It is I, the one and only. I am your creator, am I not? No... I don't mean your parent--I would never do such a heinous thing. I am your greater creator (look at that rhyme!), not quite at the deity level but close. You can call me your "dreamer" if you must assign a value to my being, but otherwise I am just a shadow. I follow you around (I always have) but you've gone to a place I cannot find. You've become something of an elusivity, the only foil in my dream-like perfection. So now we meet, I presume, and I must find a way to secure your soul. No, don't be afraid. I've always been right around the corner.
