<h1 id="text1">So... what is this masterpiece?</h1><p1 id="text2">I created this image after I found myself in a bit of a pickle, so to speak. See, I had told a friend of mine that I had seen her sister in the school hallway (this was a lie). My friend, sensing the illegitimacy of this comment, asked me why her sister, who does not know me, would ever come up to me in the first place. I told her that I was wearing a shirt with her (the friend's) face on it and that her sister was so shocked she came up to me to ask me about it. My friend was clearly wary of my comments, but I tried to keep up the ruse as long as possible. I told her I'd send her a photo of said shirt when I got home, then pretended I wasn't at home while I frantically scrambled for an online image editor to put her yearbook photo onto a shirt I found. Finding nothing that would let me use their services without an account, I turned to the school-provided Adobe subscription. I figured I could probably figure out Photoshop in time to send my friend a believable image of me wearing a shirt with her face on it. I was clearly wrong (keep in mind making this photo took me far too long, as I was insistent that it needed to look as realistic as possible). Believe it or not, though, I learned a lot from absolutely failing my first attempt at Photoshp. First of all, I figured out pretty fast that just taking my face from another image of me and putting it onto a random woman wasn't going to cut it. More importantly, though, it left me resolved to actually trick my friend into thinking something I'd photoshopped was real. </p1>
