<h1>
This is my first journal entry.
</h1>
<p>
Last class we linked our folders to the Internet using Github. We went into Terminal and were able to see our desktop as a folder. We went into our website folder using code. That was what we linked to Github.
</p>
<h2>
How to add things to my online website.
</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Open my terminal and navigate to my folder by typing cd ./desktop/c27if.github.io</li>
	<li> If I want to see anything I added I can type git status and it will show me anything I changed.
	</li>
	<li>To add the changes I made to my website in Sublime Text I type <b> git add .</b></li>
	<li>Then I commit my changes and add a message to myself using <b>git commit -m "whatever I just did"</b></li>
	<li>When I want to finalize the changes, I write <b>git push</b></li>

<h3>10/6/23</h3>
<p id="p2">I changed around my home page quite a bit and have an idea to turn it into a female rage thing. I also changed my projects page to be a cool potions lab. I'm still trying to figure out how to do exactly what I want, but I have a lab with Molly soon and I think she'll help me figure it out. </p>

<h4>10/13/23</h4>
<p id="p3">It's Friday the 13th. We've done a lot of Molly showing us things, like the boxes project, and not giving us a lot of time to work. I truly want to make my website pop, but I feel I don't have the time. In other news, we've learned how to make animations (mine hasn't worked yet) and used the classify tool to group several divs under one category. I'm trying to make mine an alpaca vs alfalfa thing, but I may need to rethink my strategy.</p>

<h5>11/1/23</h5>
<p id="p4"> I finished my jumpscare after a lab with Molly about if/then commands (kind of like Scratch). I'm very proud of it because I find it funny and a little disturbing (kind of like The Nun movie). Speaking of which, I am setting a goal for myself unrelated to comp sci to have watched Saint Maud (a movie) before the end of senior year and preferably with friends. Halloween was very fun but I think I'm getting a little too old for it. 78th street is CRAZY because they block of the street and there's loud music and tiny children trying to cut you -- all the good stuff. It was a little stressful because I had two majorly minor assessments due the next day (today), but I managed to get them done with plenty of time to spare.

<p id="p5">
3 Questions I Have about the Video:</p>
<p id="p6">
	1. How does the "," command work in JavaScript? 
</p>
<p id="p7">
	2. How do JavaScript equations work and when should you use them vs. using a function?
</p>
<p id="p8">
	3. How can you change other elements of a div other than the color? 
</p>
<p id="p9">
	Bonus Question: Does Molly have a cat (I heard a meow in the video)?
</p>
