<h1>
This is my first journal entry.
</h1>
<p>
Last class we linked our folders to the Internet using Github. We went into Terminal and were able to see our desktop as a folder. We went into our website folder using code. That was what we linked to Github.

<h2>
How to add things to my online website.
</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Open my terminal and navigate to my folder by typing cd ./desktop/c27if.github.io</li>
	<li> If I want to see anything I added I can type git status and it will show me anything I changed.
	</li>
	<li>To add the changes I made to my website in Sublime Text I type <b> git add .</b></li>
	<li>Then I commit my changes and add a message to myself using <b>git commit -m "whatever I just did"</b></li>
	<li>When I want to finalize the changes, I write <b>git push</b></li>

</ol>
