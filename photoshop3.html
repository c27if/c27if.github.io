<h1 id="text1">Horror on the weekend?</h1><p1 id="text2">Where would my Photoshop adventure lead next? The journey was bound to surpass just a prank (or life or death mission, depending on who you ask) I wanted to play on my friend. Considering that I'd spent several hours of my life already on just two images, both with very selfish purposes (fooling the foolish friend), I figured it was time to take it to the next level. Actually, this is a much more heroic description of what happened. The real reason I decided to start making more Photoshops was just that I was bored one weekend and couldn't think of anything better to do. Still, this weekend would become monumental (to no one except for like half of half of half of the right side of my brain [which is sitll a decent amount]). This was the weekend I learned that I could use Photoshop to do basically whatever I wanted. Literally. I started searching random, unassuming images, who had no idea that until this very moment, they had never known true creativity. Their entire lives were about to be changed. Well, more like I decided to play around with different and honestly sort of boring images and turn them into WHATEVER THE HELL I WANTED because 'MURICA values free expression (ignoring copyright laws &c) AND GUNS (I did not include any weapons in any of my images). This weekend became the weekend I learned Photoshop's true capabilties (and apparently did not have any homework whatsoever). I learned about opacity, color filters, &c. More than that, though, I learned that Photoshop was not limited to putting articles of clothing on people who may or may not be artificially generated. Although this image may not be the best thing I've ever done, it was a real step in learning to embrace my creativity (and getting yelled at a whole bunch more by my artsy friends). According to the very friend who I semi-successfully fooled, the things I would begin to create this weekend were "art." </p1>

<!-- <p1 id="text2">I created this image after I found myself in a bit of a pickle, so to speak. See, I had told a friend of mine that I had seen her sister in the school hallway (this was a lie). My friend, sensing the illegitimacy of this comment, asked me why her sister, who does not know me, would ever come up to me in the first place. I told her that I was wearing a shirt with her (the friend's) face on it and that her sister was so shocked she came up to me to ask me about it. My friend was clearly wary of my comments, but I tried to keep up the ruse as long as possible. I told her I'd send her a photo of said shirt when I got home, then pretended I wasn't at home while I frantically scrambled for an online image editor to put her yearbook photo onto a shirt I found. Finding nothing that would let me use their services without an account, I turned to the school-provided Adobe subscription. I figured I could probably figure out Photoshop in time to send my friend a believable image of me wearing a shirt with her face on it. I was clearly wrong (keep in mind making this photo took me far too long, as I was insistent that it needed to look as realistic as possible). Believe it or not, though, I learned a lot from absolutely failing my first attempt at Photoshp. First of all, I figured out pretty fast that just taking my face from another image of me and putting it onto a random woman wasn't going to cut it. More importantly, though, it left me resolved to actually trick my friend into thinking something I'd photoshopped was real. </p1> -->
